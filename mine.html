    <h1>Where the Magic Happens!</h1>
    <h4>About Me:</h4>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Kyle. I started coding here at Epicodus this September (2017), and can't wait to see what comes of it!</p>

    <h4>Programming Goals:</h4>
    <p>There are quite a few things I've dreamt of accomplishing in programming. For example: Creating a MMORPG that displaces WoW as (what I would consider) one of the greatest games of all time.</p>
      <ul><strong>Here are some program specific goals:</strong>
        <li>Become capable of programming systems capable of in-depth analysis that will be effective in various business practices.</li>
        <li>Complete at least 2 projects on my own time during the course.</li>
        <li>Earn a job offer from my internship site.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>And here are some personal goals I'd like to achieve within the next 3-5 years:</strong>
        <li>Become a well-versed full-stack developer.</li>
        <li>Develop the tools to start my own business.</li>
        <li>Work remote, with 10+ weeks off every year.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Why work remote? Check it out: <a href="file:///C:/Users/Ebby/Desktop/mine/climb.html">The mountains are calling.</a></p>
